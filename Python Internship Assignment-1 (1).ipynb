    "An integer is a data type used to represent whole numbers without any decimal or fractional part. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero. In most programming languages, integers have a fixed size, which determines the range of values they can represent. For example, a 32-bit integer can represent values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Integers are commonly used for counting, indexing, and performing arithmetic operations.\n",

Strings are typically enclosed within single quotes (' ') or double quotes (\" \").

String manipulation operations include concatenation (joining strings together), substring extraction, searching, and replacing.\n",

Double-precision floating-point numbers offer a larger range and higher precision compared to single-precision floats. Floating-point numbers are commonly used for representing measurements, scientific calculations, and other applications requiring real-number arithmetic."
